                        Quizaa is a game of "Higher" or "Lower" where you can play against one or more bots.
                        The game is based on the quality of your memory, and a bit of luck.
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Quizaa game leader has choosen a number, and it is up to you to try and guess the correct number before your opponent/s do.
                    If your guess is wrong, the game leader will tell you weather the correct number is "Higher!" or "Lower!".
                    The same goes for the bots, so if they don't get it right either you can use their answers to your advantage.
                    The bots have different internal logic for choosing a number, and can be more or less difficult to go up against.

                    <p>
                        You will then be promted to write a number.
                        Make sure you write a valid number within the range that is visible on screen.

                    <p>
                        Make sure to answer quickly, you have five seconds.
                        If you do not answer in time, you will not be able to guess during this round.

                <div class="list-item flex row">

                    <p>
                        Then it is the bots turn to guess. 
                        If one or more of them guesses the correct number, you lose.
                        If they guess the wrong number, you get to try and guess again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you or the bots answer the correct number, the game is over.
                        You can then choose to either play another game, or go back to the main menu.
